      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we talk about robot programming, we should spend a quick minute thinking about what the robot exoskeleton that we use is made of and what parts are inside. THis will allows us to later understand what is going on, when we talk about connecting bus systems to actuators and reading pressure values from sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-are-robots-made-of&#34;&gt;What are robots made of?&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our case, the robot is always the exoskeleton, or at the very least a simulation of the exoskeleton. There are plenty of other robots out there, from specialized industry machinery like pick and place machines tha assemble PCBs, humanoid bipedal walking robot like the famous Boston Dynamics Atlas, Quadrupeds like ANYmal that most resemble dogs or robotic arms with gripper attachments that can help to move small object around in environments designed for humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-little-bit-of-history&#34;&gt;A little bit of History!&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ROS stands for Robot Operating System, yet it is not an operating system. Most accurately, we may describe ROS2 as a collection of tools, libraries, middleware and a community of packages that can be used to control some robots. The federated structure, and the modular nature of the system allows users to interchange software packages inbetween projects, and make components reusable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally this was, and still is not always the most straight forward approach. Robots are by nature quite heterogenous machines, in that two robots must not share any two components or even remotely look alike. This makes robot programming hard and equally heterogenous, people and companies usually started by developing robot software specifically tailored to their own needs, which is in many cases the right approach for companies with large R&amp;amp;D budgets and many people involved in development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
