### Chapter I

# Installation & Setup

[**Slides**](https://github.com/riserobotics/ros2course-presentations/raw/dd9d2de597104d1f78851b274ccf3a45bfafa4e7/presentation-intro/intro.pdf)

In this chapter we explain to you how to set up the ROS2 environment for understanding the framework and developing code within the project. This is not identical to the setup instructions for the RISE-OS software stack that we will eventually develop, however it's very similar :)
